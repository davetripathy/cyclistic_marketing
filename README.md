**Navigating a Bike-Share company’s speedy success**_

***Note: All the scenarios and names are fictional.**

**Scenario**:

- Role: Data Analyst
- Company Name: Cyclistic
- Industry Sector : Transportation
- Fleet : 5824
- Stations: 692
- Department : Marketing
- Reporting : Director of Marketing
- Task : 
- To understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- Use the insights to carve out a marketing strategy [ Team Task ]
- Headquarters: Chicago
- Goal : Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members



_**Casual Riders** : Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes.
**Cyclistic Members** : Customers purchasing an annual membership._

## **Useful Information: **
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs

## Collect the Data
You will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. [Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data
here.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) **(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the
datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by[ Motivate
International Inc. under this license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).)** This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using
Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means
that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service
area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
